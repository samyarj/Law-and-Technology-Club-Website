# Law & Technology Website ⚖️

This repository contains the code to the website that aims to promote the Law & Technology Club's activity.

## Getting Started 🚀
* To run the website locally, simply clone the repository and run `src/index.html`. 
* The website is also hosted online: https://droit-tech-udem.com/

## File structure 📁
* There are 4 HTML pages: `index.html`, `execs.html`, `events.html` & `podcast.html`.
* There is at least one CSS stylesheet for each HTML page: `main3.css`, `events.css`, `mission.css`, `nav.css`, and `podcast.css`.
* The `script.js` file programs the navigation bar, and only appears on the mobile version.

## Repository Transfer 📦
* This repository is a transfer from my old GitHub account. [The original repository](https://github.com/samyarjan10/droit-tech-udem) is still hosted in my old account and I am still using it to host the website via GitHub Pages.
* The reason for this transfer is to consolidate all my repositories under one account for better organization and management. I have made sure to transfer all the relevant information, including code, issues, and pull requests to this new repository. Please note that the repository history may have been altered during the transfer process, but all the important information and code should remain intact.
